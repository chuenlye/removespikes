Subject: script to remove spikes

I was looking contributors' scripts to remove spikes in rendered graphs
and all they were very simple and, often, ineffective. So, I had no
choice but to build my own "killspike" script. It's finished and fully
operational and I think it could be useful to more people.

Script is written in perl and, despite comments are in spanish (my
natural language), script is relatively understandable. This is the way
the script works:

this script takes rrd values and dumps them in xml format, scans peaks 
(checking for increments/decrements in exponential indexes) and creates
an internal hash with those deltas and another hash to store frequency
of those delta and percentages.

For example, if we're talking about a FastEthernet traffic graph, delta
between values will never reach 100mbps, so a peak will be giga or tera
deltas. Normal traffic means 99% graph, and peaks are very very rare
(less than 0.6%). Thus, script kills all deltas that appears less than 0.6%.

Thanks a lot and receive my most humble congratulations for rrdtool :)

Regards,
